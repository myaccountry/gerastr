# Gera / Grisha strings for C++
Just me trying make my own std libs if anyone care

1. Clone repository
`git clone https://github.com/myaccountry/gerastr.git`
(linux install guide only, for windows construct yourselfs)

2. Make object files and archived library
`make`
3. Install library to system
`make install`
4. Clean trash
`make clean`

5. Or instead of 2, 3, 4 just type:
`make all`
(its just make && make install && make clean)

Use it!
`#include <gerastr.h>`
On compilation add 
`-l gerastr`

thanks
